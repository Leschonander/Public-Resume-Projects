These are programming projects that I feel willing to display on Github and in public for people to look at if they want. 

For now have three projects, one basic data analysis project I did in R for Hackital. 2ndly I have a basic statistics project done in R I did for my Business and Economic Statistics I class. Thirdly, I have some correlations, and other manipulations of Spotify data I did in R to see what Spotify's API can do.
